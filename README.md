# Make the Web Great Again

_Do you remember when the web was great?_

There was a time when the internet was full of crude TP memes, suggestive
references, and mischievous delight.

I kind of miss that logo.  The web was so much better when it was plastered
everywhere.

If you long for those days, this Chrome Plugin can **Make the Web Great Again!**

# What does it do?

It replaces every image that has a reference to `trump` or `pence` in the URL
with the original Trump-Pence logo.
